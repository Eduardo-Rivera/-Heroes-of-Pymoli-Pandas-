# Heroes of Pymoli 
This module runs on Jupyter Notebook (Activate Jupyter Notebook).

## About This Project
Developers of a free online game 'Heroes of Pymoli' need insight on purchasing data from all their users. The analysis consists of variables calculating:
- **Total number of Players**
- **Purchasing Analysis**
     - **_Number of Unique Items_**
     - **_Average Purchase Price_**
     - **_Total Number of Purchases_**
     - **_Total Revenue_** 

- **Demographics**
  - **_Age_**
  - **_Gender_**
  
- **Most Popular Items** 
    ###### _(these will be assigned then listed to be able to isolate)_ 
  - **Identified and counted the five most popular items by purchase count**
    - _Item ID_
    - _Item Name_
    - _Item Price_
    - _Purchase Count_
    - _Total Purchase Value_
    
- **Most Profitable Items**
  - **Identified and counted five most profitable**
    - _Item ID_
    - _Item Name_
    - _Item Price_
    - _Purchase Count_
    - _Total Purchase Count_
    
## Analysis
	The urban category has a high volume of total fares, drivers, and total number of rides across the board, but as for rural cities, it is significantly low compared to each other. One can assume the demand is higher in high traffic areas and therefore is met with the demand to satisfy the need for rideshare service.
    
	In suburban areas, the percentage of total fares by city is only half of the total amount of Urban fares (30.5% compared to 62.7%), one possible factor could be the distance from the outskirts of urban areas for leisure or work purposes and other miscellaneous trips. Rural is a bit increased as well because of the distance it must make up for, but one can assume that there isnâ€™t much demand in rural areas, so the percentage would still be lower compared to other categories.

	In conclusion, where there is a demand to be met in suburban areas compared to a densely populated area, the results are immensely different. Distance can also play a role in higher fares but that might also discourage the total of rides in that certain area for future trips; so this could be another experiment worth looking into by implementing a survey to those that live in rural areas compared to urban and suburban.
